# Skeleton code for problem https://uchicago.kattis.com/problems/uchicago.shortmanhattan
#
# Make sure you read the problem before editing this code.
#
# You should focus only on implementing the find_paths() function.  Do not
# modify any other code.

# This function takes four parameters: x0, y0, x1, y1 (as defined
# in the problem statement)
#
# The function must return a list of all the shortest paths from (x0,y0) to
# (x1, y1). For example:
#
#    find_paths(0,0,1,1) would return [["right", "up"], ["up", "right"]]
#    find_paths(1,1,0,0) would return [["left", "down"], ["down", "left"]]
#
# Note: The order of the paths is not important. e.g., the first call could
#       return [["up", "right"], ["right", "up"]] and it would also be correct.
#
# Note (2): If there are no shortest paths (because you're finding the path from
#           one point to itself, the function must return [[]] (i.e., a list with
#           just one path: the empty path.
def find_paths(x0,y0,x1,y1):
    # your code goes here
    return []
